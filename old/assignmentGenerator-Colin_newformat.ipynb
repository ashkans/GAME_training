      "\tThis Problem Set explores the topic of direct stiffness method. Familiarity with identifying unknown degrees of freedom, following the step-by-step procedure, and drawing bending moment and torsion moment diagram are necessary. This topic contributes to unit Learning Outcome 3: \\textit{Determine the structural behaviour of various bridge types quantitatively and qualitatively using relevant hand- and computer-based methods}. By being competent at analysing simple structures by hand using the stiffness method, you will be better placed to correctly use and understand the output of computer analyses of more complex models.\n",
